# Sourcing Parts

This build recycles most of the frame and electronics from the Ender 3. However some new motion components are required such as the linear rods and bearings. Additional fasteners are also needed and the new structural components must be 3D printed.

As of this writing, there are no official parts kits (printed or otherwise). All of the required parts, STLs, and sourcing recommendations are on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy-beta).

## Tools and Miscellaneous Items

Depending on your tool collection and how in depth this build goes, some additional things will be nice to have on hand that may have not been specified in the BOM.

So far, I have made use of the following tools:

* Decent (metric) allen keys
* Small screwdrivers
* Needle nose pliers and/or tweezers
* Wire cutters & strippers
* Assorted crimping tools (pin, terminal, ferrule)
* Deburring tool
* Lighter
* Soldering iron

The same goes for these consumables:

* Grease (Mobilux EP2)
* Blue Loctite
* CA (super) glue
* Zip ties
* Heat shrink

Fortunately, I had most of these things left over from previous projects. 

## Cost Breakdown

I put together a small breakdown to help me keep track of costs and help justify expenses. I mean if I already owned the part... it was technically free, right?

| Category    | BOM Estimate | My Cost |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Motion      | $163.51       | $114.87  | 
| Electronics | $42.64        | $20.44   | 
| Boards      | $44.48        | $13.95   |
| Hotend      | $43.97        | --       |
| Hardware    | --            | $40      |
| Filament    | --            | $60.93   |
| **TOTALS**      | **$294.60**       | **$250.19**  |

<small>Prices in USD</small>

Not all costs were accounted for but this gives a rough estimate. Assuming and Ender style printer is already on hand, I expect most people can complete this conversion for less than $300 USD in parts.
