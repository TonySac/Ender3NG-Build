This section of the includes some extra things I made for my E3NG and the community.

# Mainsail Theme

I threw together a pretty basic Mainsail theme based around the Ender 3 NG. It includes logos and sidebar images. I'm a fan of the default dark interface so I left most that as is.

The theme can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TonySac/E3NG-Mainsail-Theme). More info on Mainsail themes can be found [here](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/overview/features/themes).

# Serial Plate

I threw together a simple serial plate for those with serialized E3NGs. I mounted it on the 2040 extrusion mod uprights but it can really go anywhere there is a free extrusion slot. It is still a work in progress. The files are all on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/874151-e3ng-serial-plate-for-2040-upright). These include a STEP file without any text and a F3D file for easy editing of the serial number.
