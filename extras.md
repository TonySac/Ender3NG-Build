This section of the docs includes some extra things I made for my E3NG and the community.

# Mainsail Theme

I threw together a pretty basic Mainsail theme based around the Ender 3 NG. It includes logos and sidebar images. I'm a fan of the default dark interface so I left most that as is.

The theme can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TonySac/E3NG-Mainsail-Theme). More info on Mainsail themes can be found [here](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/overview/features/themes).
