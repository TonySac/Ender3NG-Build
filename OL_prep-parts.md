# Preparing the Parts

In order to streamline assembly, I'm preparing the parts as I print them. My preparation includes taking inventory, inspecting, and post processing. I'll check off the BOM as parts come of the printer and things are received.

{: .tip }
Prior to starting the build double check everything is on hand. Especially the printed parts.

## Inspection and Post Process

As the parts came off the printer, I inspected them for quality. I already confirmed tolerances with the calibration cube prior to producing my parts. At this point, I was looking at the finish and for any unacceptable defects.

For example, I would not tolerate any warping of structural components. I was however, more forgiving of the thinner electronics enclosure parts I printed on the ole Ender.

{: .warning }
Be careful with sharp tools and heat sources.

Brims were removed and the edges cleaned up. I used a deburring tool and a small pick in this process. I also ran a lighter along the edges to remove discoloration and further smooth things out.

{: .note }
A heat gun would probably have been a better choice.

## Heat Inserts

I just went page by page in the build manual and sunk the appropriate heat inserts into the printed parts. Placing the inserts prior to assembly made it easer to just pickup and go rather than pause at each step to prepare parts.
