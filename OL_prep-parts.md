# Preparing the Parts

In order to streamline assembly, I'm preparing the parts as I print them. This includes taking inventory, inspecting, and post processing. I check off everything from the BOM as it is printed or received. 

Prior to starting the build, I will double check and print or source anything missing.

## Inspection and Post Process

As the parts came off the printer, I inspected them for quality. I already confirmed tolerances with the calibration cube prior to producing my parts. At this point, I was looking at the finish and for any unacceptable defects.

For example, I would not tolerate any warping of structural components. I was however, more forgiving of the thinner electronics enclosure parts I printed on the ole Ender.

Brims were removed and the edges cleaned up. I used a deburring tool and some high grit sandpaper as needed. I would also run a lighter along the edges to remove discoloration and further smooth things out.

A heat gun would probably have been a better choice.
