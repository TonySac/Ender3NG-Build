# Sourcing Parts

This build recycles most of the frame and electronics from the Ender 3. However some new motion components are required such as the linear rods and bearings. Additional fasteners are also needed and the new structural components must be 3D printed.

Currently, there is no *Print it Forward* program. Nor are there any official kits for this build, at least not yet. All of the required parts, STLs, and sourcing recommendations are on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy-beta).

## Tools and Miscellaneous Items

Depending on your tool collection and how in depth this build goes, some additional things will be nice to have on hand that may have not been specified in the BOM.

I made use of the following tools during the build:

* Decent (metric) allen keys
* Small screwdrivers
* Needle nose pliers and/or tweezers
* Wire cutters & strippers
* Assorted crimping tools (pin, terminal, ferrule)
* Tap set
* Magnet
* Syringes
* Deburring tool
* Lighter
* Soldering iron

The same goes for these consumables:

* Grease (Mobilux EP2)
* Blue Loctite
* CA (super) glue
* Zip ties
* Heat shrink

Fortunately, I had most of these things left over from previous projects. 

## Cost Breakdown

I put together a small breakdown to help me keep track of costs and help justify expenses. I mean if I already owned the part... it was technically free, right?

| Category    | BOM Estimate | My Cost |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Motion      | $163.51       | $114.87  | 
| Electronics | $42.64        | $20.44   | 
| Boards      | $44.48        | $13.95   |
| Hotend      | $43.97        | --       |
| Hardware    | --            | $40      |
| Filament    | --            | $60.93   |
| **TOTALS**      | **$294.60**       | **$250.19**  |

<small>Prices in USD</small>

Not all costs were accounted for but this gives a rough estimate. I discuss some of these categories in more detail on the following pages.
