# The Maker Medic's Ender 3 NG

---

This documentation logs my Ender 3 NG build. It serves as a log of my process and in parts an unofficial guide. I did not build this E3NG exactly to spec. It will likely become a project printer that I continue to tinker with. I plan to continue to update these pages as things change and progress. I started the build process in March 2024 when the project was still in beta release.

I've attempted to call out things I found along the build journey using the following highlights:

{: .mod }
:wrench: Modifications

{: .warn }
:warning: Warnings

## Background

The Ender 3 NG is a coreXY conversion for the Ender 3 series of printers. The project was created by RH3D and all information about the Ender 3 NG project can be found on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy-beta). This includes the official build manual, the bill of materials and sourcing guide, STLs, and more.

After building a Voron 0.2, I initially planned on converting my old Ender 3 Neo into a Voron Switchwire. When I stumbled upon the Ender 3 NG project I decided to change directions. I preferred the coreXY motion system of the Voron 0.2 and wanted a printer I could continue to tinker with.
