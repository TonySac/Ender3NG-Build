# The Maker Medic's Ender 3 NG

---

This documentation logs my Ender 3 NG build. It serves as a log of my process and in some parts an unofficial guide. I did not build this E3NG exactly to spec. It will likely become a project printer that I continue to tinker with. I plan to continue to update these pages as things change and progress. I started the project in March 2024 during a in beta release.

I've attempted to call out things I found along the build journey using the following highlights:

## Timeline

As of mid April 2024, I was successfully printing on the E3NG. I spent the month of March intermittently printing parts on my Voron 0.2 and the donor Ender 3. Mechanical assembly took roughly 1.5 days and wiring up electronics took another half to full day. Outside of printing and sourcing parts, it took me about 2-3 days to go from boxes of parts to a functional printer.

## Background

The Ender 3 NG is a coreXY conversion for the Ender 3 series of printers. The project was created by RH3D and all information about the Ender 3 NG project can be found on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy-beta). This includes the official build manual, the bill of materials and sourcing guide, STLs, and more.

After building a Voron 0.2, I initially planned on converting my old Ender 3 Neo into a Voron Switchwire. When I stumbled upon the Ender 3 NG project I decided to change directions. I preferred the coreXY motion system of the Voron 0.2 and wanted a printer I could continue to tinker with.
