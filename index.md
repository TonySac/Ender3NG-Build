# The Maker Medic's Ender 3 NG

I designed this site to log my Ender 3 NG build. It may read as both a process log and unofficial guide on the build process.

Not everything in this log is to spec. I have attempted to use the following highlights in this documentation:

{: .note}
General notes

{: .tip}
Tips and tricks 

{: .mod }
Changes made when compared to the official documentation

{: .warning }
Warnings of potential property damage or physical harm

## Background

The Ender 3 NG is a coreXY conversion for the Ender 3 series of printers. The project was created by RH3D and all information about the Ender 3 NG project can be found on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy-beta). This includes the official build manual, bill of materials/sourcing guide, STLs, and more.

After building a Voron 0.2, I initially planned on converting my old Ender 3 Neo into a Voron Switchwire. When I stumbled upon the Ender 3 NG project I decided to change directions. I preferred the coreXY motion system of the Voron 0.2 and wanted a printer I could continue to tinker with.

## Progress

* March 2024 - Printing parts
