Once again, the wiring outlined here is my how I wired up my E3NG. It includes additional hardware for Klipper and CANbus. It is provided for my reference and inspiration.

{: .warn }
:warning: Incorrectly wiring components can cause damage to them or at worst personal injury.

Wires should be routed in a clean manner. This means out of the way of motion components and not pinched, kinked, or otherwise damaged. Always use the correct wire gauge. Securely crimp all connections and use electrical tape and/or heat shrink to prevent shorting. Standard color conventions are especially important for power wires. Label wires as needed.

# Mainboard Wiring

The BTT GitHub provides a pinout and schematic of the SKR Mini E3 V3. I have included a copy of the pinout for reference. Using this diagram, wiring the board is pretty straight forward.
