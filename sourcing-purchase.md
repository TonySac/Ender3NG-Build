After raiding my spare parts, I turned to the BOM and sourcing guide to acquire anything that was missing or I wanted to add.

{: .note }
:pencil: The BOM not only contains the recommended parts but also affiliate links that help support the project. Consider souring parts directly from the BOM.

{: .tip }
:bulb: Think about the lead times when ordering parts and plan the build accordingly.

## Motion

I sourced most of this exactly as specified in the BOM from Aliexpress using the affiliate links. My plans include the 2040 extrusion mod and reusing the Z axis lead screw.

{: .mod }
:wrench: I have upgraded NEMA 17 steppers on my Ender that will carry over.

## Electronics

I already have a BTT SKR Mini E3 V3 in my Ender 3. I added the extended screen cable to my order as I prefer the basic LCD over a touchscreen. I also picked up some DIN rails off Aliexpress. Originally, I considered using the printed DIN cleats from the Voron 0 repo but decided to go with actual rails. I even grabbed an extra to upgrade the Voron.

{: .note }
:pencil: No wiring information is included in the offical docs. I had plenty of 16-22 AWG wire and various connectors (JST, Molex, ferrules, etc.) in my spare parts for any needs.

{: .mod }
:wrench: I plan to use CANBus with a BTT EBB36 CANBus tool head board. I have one in the Voron 0.2 and enjoyed the process of setting it up along with the simplified wiring.

## Hotend

{: .mod }
:wrench: My Ender is already equipped with [Voron Stealthburner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner) from my planned Switchwire conversion.

## Hardware

Once again, my parts drawer is full of miscellaneous hardware. However, I lacked most of the socket head screws. I elected to go with an unofficial hardware kit to get started. It contained most of the required parts. Anything remaining I either had laying around or sourced locally. 

## Enclosure

I downloaded the STEP file for information on the enclosure. Once I complete the build, I will revisit enclosing the unit.
