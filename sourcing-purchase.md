# Purchasing and Ordering Parts

After raiding my spare parts, I turned to the BOM and sourcing guide to acquire anything that was missing or I wanted to add. It's worth noting, the links in the BOM are affiliates that help support the original Ender 3 NG project and creator.

{: .note }
Consider the lead time on parts when planning your build. Especially if ordering from overseas.

## Motion

I sourced most of this exactly as specified in the BOM from Aliexpress using the affiliate links. My plans include the 2040 extrusion mod and reusing the Z axis lead screw.

{: .mod }
I previously upgraded the NEMA 17 steppers on my Ender and will carry these over to this build.

## Electronics

I already have a BTT SKR Mini E3 V3 in my Ender 3. I added the extended screen cable to my order as I prefer the basic LCD over something like [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I also picked up some DIN rails off Aliexpress. Originally, I considered using the printed DIN cleats from the Voron 0 repo but decided to go with actual rails. I even grabbed an extra to upgrade the Voron.

{: .tip }
Not a lot of information regarding wiring is included in the docs. I had plenty of 16-22 AWG wire and various connectors (JST, Molex, ferrules, etc.) in my spare parts for any needs. 

{: .mod }
I plan to use CANBus with a BTT EBB36 CANBus tool head board. I have one in the Voron 0.2 and enjoyed the process of setting it up along with the simplified wiring.

## Hotend

{: .mod }
I upgraded my Ender 3 with a [Voron Stealthburner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner). I will be using this same toolhead on the Ender 3 NG.

## Hardware

Once again, my parts drawer is full of miscellaneous hardware. However, I lacked most of the socket head screws. I elected to go with an unofficial hardware kit to get started. It contained most of the required parts. Anything remaining I either had laying around or sourced locally. 

## Enclosure

I downloaded the STEP file for information on the beta enclosure. Once I complete the build, I will revisit enclosing the unit and update this document.
