# Purchasing and Ordering Parts

After raiding my spare parts, I turned to the BOM and sourcing guide to acquire anything that was missing or I wanted to add. It's worth noting, the links in the BOM are affiliates that help support the original Ender 3 NG project and creator.

Consider the lead time on parts when planning your build. Especially if ordering from overseas.

## Motion

I sourced exactly what was specified in the BOM from Aliexpress using the affiliate links. I do plan on recycling one of the lead screws. I also plan on building with the 2040 extrusion mod so I picked up a cheap pair of those.

## Electronics & Hotend

The Ender 3 I will be cannibalizing already has a BTT SKR Mini E3 V3 installed along with a [Voron Stealthburner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner). I will be recycling those into this build, saving me some cash on electronics and hotend parts. 

I did however order a BTT EBB36 CANBus toolhead board. I have one in the Voron 0.2 and enjoyed the process of setting it up along with the simplified wiring. I also picked up the extended screen cable.

I considered using printed DIN cleats similar to my Voron 0.2 but ultimately decided to buy some for both this printer and to add to the Voron.

My spare parts box is full of 16-22 AWG wire and various connectors I will be using when the time comes to build the wiring harness. 

## Hardware

Once again, my parts drawer is full of miscellaneous hardware but I was lacking in most of the socket head screws. I elected to go with an unofficial hardware kit to get started. It contained most of the required parts. Anything remaining I either had laying around or sourced locally. 

## Enclosure

I have been informed the STEP file contains information on enclosing the printer. As of now, I have not sourced anything for the enclosure. I plan to complete the build then revisit enclosing the unit and will update this accordingly.
